# RaylibTemplate
Raylib template for Visual Studio Code (MacOS) for C++ coding.

## Homebrew Installation (macOS)
Homebrew installation is the recommended way to manage your libraries, including wxWidgets.

### Install Homebrew:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Install Raylib:

```
brew install raylib
```

## Using the Template
If you open the folder in VSCode, you can press `F5` to debug the application immediately. Select `Build and Launch (MAC)` from the menu. This will generate a `/build` folder and an application named `RaylibTemplate` within it.
